# JSON-and-XML-Formatter

I work with JSON and XML on a daily basis as a result of debugging issues with API's.

Some of the data in the API requests/responses cannot be used in online beautifiers, due to GDPR, PCI DSS, etc... 
So this is my effort in creating something to make my life easier at work.

This application, built in python, will format any XML and JSON data you give it.
You can save the outputted JSON/XML into a password protected + compressed file 

There is also a "spongebob text" button - which if you are familiar with the spongebob memes, you will understand why this is a must!
